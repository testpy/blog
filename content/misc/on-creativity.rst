:summary: creativity ...or not

We all know that if we organize our work, things would go smoother and we would
gain more time to focus on more important items, such as automation or load
testing.  Or is it? Think about it… Everything is organized, everyone follows
the rules, the project management team couldn’t be happier. But what about
creativity? When do we have time to be creative and innovate? To change the
course of the project by implementing an idea seemingly so crazy at first, that
no one thought it could be a success.

Where would all major software companies be today, if they would have devoted
their time to rewriting and implementing the rules, just to make sure
everything goes as planned? Instead of thinking of new approaches, of how we
could revolutionize the work we are doing, we spent a large part of our time
following the same old rules, which do not benefit neither the project, nor the
people working on the project.

Let’s take for example test cases management tools. I understand that they are
able to provide reports, and colored graphs (really difficult to understand at
times), and we all know managers do like graphs. But are these reports useful
to someone (at least in agile environments)? Is someone actually spending time
to look at the reports and analyze them? I doubt it. Managers are interested in
results. And while they like to see some reports from time to time, I think
they would be more happy knowing the product is well tested, regardless of the
test cases management tool used.

Instead of this very watterfall-ish approach, I would suggest investing more
time in automation testing and documenting the scripts, so that everyone
involved in the project, including non-technical people, knows what is being
tested. BDD-like tools provide this functionality out of the box, via Gherkin
language. As for other tools, make sure to document the scripts so they can
serve as a living documentation.

Let’s step out of the line from time to time, and embrace creativity more!
