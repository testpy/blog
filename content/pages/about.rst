About us
--------

Welcome to the testpy.org! Here, we discuss topics related to software testing
(both manual and automated), business analysis, book reviews and more.

Running a blog together is a good way to keep in touch and also sharpen our
minds at the same time.

We love testing and we love talking about it.
