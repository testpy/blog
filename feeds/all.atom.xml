presentation at RTC, but given that this experience has had an impact on our
testing perspective, we decided to write a few lines on how it was and what it
meant to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were pleasantly surprised to see that many colleagues share our opinions on
software testing and this alone was enough to get us through the emotions we
had that day, simply because we knew that we were speaking the same language.
More and more software testers believe in the unity of the team, without the
need of separating the tester (improperly called QA by many still) and
developer roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided  to talk about “Our experience with BDD in Python”, and throughout
the presentation, we did exactly that: we talked about BDD as we understood and
practiced it. We wanted to avoid “best practices” and “how to” terminology,
because we didn’t want to teach others how to apply this methodology. We simply
wanted to share our knowledge on the item, how we applied it and what are the
challenges we are facing with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the presentation has begun, we understood that this was the
correct approach. People were drawn to what we had to say and we felt that the
issues we were exposing were issues they also had encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if we managed to answer all of their questions, but as long as we
got the audience thinking about our subject and comparing the items we
presented with the challenges they are facing day to day, then the presentation
was a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no golden formula which, when applied, it magically solves all issues
on a project. But as long as everybody has understood our message -
communication and collaboration is everything  - then we definitely can say we
are on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;

I highly recommend them if you want a deep dive into writing tests with django.
They outline some very good principles for writing effective and maintainable
tests. They also highlight a suite of test utilities and frameworks which help
you in writing better tests. Among the others, Webtest caught my attention via
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kmike/django-webtest"&gt;django-webtest&lt;/a&gt; for writing
integration/functional tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;testLoginProcess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;submit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;Log in&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;assert_contains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;Please enter a correct username and password. &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;Note that both fields are case-sensitive.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;status_code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you should choose django-webtest instead of django client ?&lt;/strong&gt;  Well,
first of all, it can better capture the user experience mainly because you can
submit forms and follow links. You are not only testing the views but also the
template html. Secondly, it will allow you to write more simple and readable
tests, an important fact when it comes to integration or functional tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It interacts with django via the WSGI interface so ajax, js will not be tested.
For that purpose you normally use selenium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve set up a project on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/danclaudiupop/django-lab-tests"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; to illustrate some
automated tests with django-webtest. It uses nose test suite runner since i
don’t want to to import all my tests into tests/__init__.py and for rest of the
goodness that nose offers.&lt;/p&gt;

There are many methodologies
that could help in testing that software product, so that the final release
contains as less bugs as possible. We are not at the point where we could say
that we have found the solution for bug free applications. But we are at the
point where we know that in order to avoid buggy, hard to use, no precise scope
defined applications, we need an approach that will ensure a higher quality of
the product. One of these ways could very well be Exploratory Testing, done
right, done different.  Exploratory Testing is important.  Exploratory Testing
can be learnt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, these are some of the messages that can be heard when
reading Explore It!, by Elisabeth Hendrickson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Cem Kaner himself states, Exploratory Testing is a style of software
testing that emphasizes the personal freedom and responsibility of the
individual tester to continually optimize the quality of his/her work by
treating test-related learning, test design, test execution, and test result
interpretation as mutually supportive activities that run in parallel
throughout the project.  That’s a pretty accurate definition. But what does
this mean exactly? How could I learn to be a more creative individual, when all
around me and my work requires 100% analytical thinking? Do I need to be more
creative, or to have a better sense of responsibility in order to execute
exploratory tests that actually find defects and weaknesses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve started looking for some of the answers I need through “Exploratory
Testing”. I have to say that I found the book incredibly easy to read and
captivating. The real-world examples were in the right places, and I could
better visualize the applicability of a concept presented in a specific
section. However, at some point, I felt that the examples became too detailed
and a more high-level explanation should have sufficed (but this is maybe a
singular opinion, I guess it depends on our own perception on exploratory
testing).  The personas concept is something I have never thought of and it’s
definitely something I would like to try with my team someday. The idea of role
playing of well-defined characters, in order to cover more classes of
vulnerabilities is one of the many out-of-the-box examples and concepts that
are defined in this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I sincerely recommend this book for any tester who would like
to better themselves. It is suitable not only for functional testers, but it
also has a few interesting approaches for the non-functional parts of the
system as well. It has great advices on how to perform a good interview and how
to do well on an interview, when faced with testing unfamiliar applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I realized is that I found a few answers, but I have also discovered
new questions and for me, this is more important. It means that the book got me
thinking and questioning - how could I become a better explorer?&lt;/p&gt;
